                So, guess what, my team won!!! I mean there were five of us, but
                still, it was our first experience with a CTF (and even
                cyber-security in general for some of us) and we are all very
                proud!
                <br />
                You might be asking, 'What exactly is a CTF?'. Well, CTF stands
                for 'Capture the Flag'. It is an event where participants need
                to use their technical skills find secret messages (or 'flags')
                hidden in a file, a website, a binary file, or in any digital
                object/system. And guess what?, it is as fun as it sounds.
                <br />
                Now, onto this particular event. 'Cyber Defenders' was a CTF
                organised by Cyscom, VIT Chennai's Branch of OWASP. The event
                was split into 2 days. The first day was supposed to be an
                introductory session with the second being the actual
                competition. Things, however didn't go as planned (porque as√≠ es
                la vida) and the first day was marred with technical issues.
